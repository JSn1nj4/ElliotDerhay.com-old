### **Warning:** This project is no longer maintained

This was a Meteor project I worked on for a while for the sake of learning something new, and because I did want my own website built on a cool tech stack that I liked. It has since been replaced by a project that handles most of its rendering server-side using Laravel instead ([JSn1nj4/ElliotDerhay.com][1]).

If you're looking for examples, please keep in mind that this is an old learning project. But otherwise, feel free to peruse the codebase. The best starting point may be the [`dev` branch][2].
